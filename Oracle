AWS reinvent check on portal:- AWS announcements on ifeerent services.

AWS GLobal Infra:-
****
(Region and a Availaibilty zone)
(Region:- geogrphalica area, US,EUrope)
(AZ:- dc)

33 geo regions and 105 AZ's

AZ in a region:- are conneted to with each other with low latency,high throughput,failover)
Elastic Ip;-
A Public IP address of an instance will change if this one is stopped. However, if you require a persistent Public IP address that can be assigned to and removed from instances, use an Elastic IP address instead.

S3:-store data as an object.
reterive any amount of data from anywhere
durabilibity:- 99.999999%%

Data Lake:_ single store of all enterprise data.

AWS Instance Types;_
General purpose:-for scale out of workloads such as webservers, containerized microservices as well as dev env's
COmpute optimized:- compute itensive workloads,distributed processing,high performance,
Mem optimized:- high perf db,in-mem,big data.
Accelerated computing:- uses GPU :- machine learning, deep learnin.
storage optimized:- distributed file systems,apachekafka.

Lab:_
Create EC2,
attach a volume to the server

fdisk -l
fdisk /dev/sdf
n
p
1


ss

mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdf1
mkdir /u01
mount /dev/sdf1 /u01
df -h
vi /ect/fstab
/dev/sdf1 /u01 defaults 0 0

Oracle secure backup:- configure
configure backup to s3
rman take backup to s3 and also u can restore it.



****RDS
setup,operate,& scale a relation db
lot of mundane dba taska are automated.
automatically take backup of db's
scale compute resorce,sstorage

***AMAZON RDS for oracle
Covered 2 licensing moddels:- BYOL, Licesnec included.
versions available 11g(11.2.04, 12c)
preconfigured paramaters.
aws cloudwatch to monitor db
Automated backups:_ PIT recovery.
Database snapsots:- user initated backups.
Scale compute and memory resources
Multi AZ deployments:- 
RDS can be created in specific VPC.
SUpports TDE
Standard edition,stanadard edition 1,2 enterprise dition.
Oracle RAC is not supporteed on RDS.
Managng time-consuming dba admn taska are done by AWS.
CLoud wants DBA to foucs on APp optimization.

![Oracle RDS respo](https://github.com/testoranit/AWSOracleCLoud/assets/124513439/0a690c83-e072-47b9-906b-513194b3a946)

*********************
Understanding Backup and Recovery in RDS.
backup's and recovery not actually in dba's control.
Automated backup's during the backup window.
u don't do rman backup's backup's are done using storage volume snapshot instead of individual databases.
Allowed to do manual backups using create snapshos.
SInle AZ db instance results in a breif I/O suspension, hence it is adivsable to do it on dev tess env and not on Prod.
for Prod go with Multi AZ and offload the backups from standby db.
The first snapshot contains data for full db instance.
rest are incrmentals.
A new instance created at the time of restore.
A new instance can be created Point in time.
RDS uploads transaction logs of DB instances to S3 every 5 mins.


* U need to have subnet group for creating a RDS
so in VPC where u have 1 Public subnet and 1 Private subnet 
create 1 more Private subnet in different AZ other then the AZ of 1st Private Subnet.
1)Once it is created got to RDS and create subnet groups and choose 2 Private subnets.

Provision an RDS instance for Oracle.
choose only private subnets in the subnet groups.


MOnitoring RDS
AWS CLoudwatch
gathers metrics CPU utlilisation of the hypervisor.
collects and processes raw data from AMAZON RDS into readable,near real time metrics.
historical stats is done but u can do a near real time.
stats are recorded for more then 2 weeks
metrics is send over a period of 1 min
configure ur RDS engine to publish log data to log group.

ENhanced monitoring.
gatheres metrcis  from an agent on the instance.
which process is taking more time on CPU
more cost.
u can do it at intital stage or later
do not need a restart
enhanced metrics are send to cloudwatch  log Grops(RDSOSMETRICS)

RDS Monitoring:- See CLoudwatch 
also see logs and events under RDS.
U can also create alarms
to email
