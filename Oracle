AWS reinvent check on portal:- AWS announcements on ifeerent services.

AWS GLobal Infra:-

(Region:- geogrphalica area, US,EUrope)
(AZ:- dc)

33 geo regions and 105 AZ's

AZ in a region:- are conneted to with each other with low latency,high throughput,failover)
Elastic Ip;-
A Public IP address of an instance will change if this one is stopped. However, if you require a persistent Public IP address that can be assigned to and removed from instances, use an Elastic IP address instead.

S3:-store data as an object.
reterive any amount of data from anywhere
durabilibity:- 99.999999%%

Data Lake:_ single store of all enterprise data.

AWS Instance Types;_
General purpose:-for scale out of workloads such as webservers, containerized microservices as well as dev env's
COmpute optimized:- compute itensive workloads,distributed processing,high performance,
Mem optimized:- high perf db,in-mem,big data.
Accelerated computing:- uses GPU :- machine learning, deep learnin.
storage optimized:- distributed file systems,apachekafka.

Lab:_
Create EC2,
attach a volume to the server

Oracle secure backup:- configure
configure backup to s3
rman take backup to s3 and also u can restore it.



****RDS
setup,operate,& scale a relation db
lot of mundane dba taska are automated.
automatically take backup of db's
scale compute resorce,sstorage

***AMAZON RDS for oracle
Covered 2 licensing moddels:- BYOL, Licesnec included.
versions available 11g(11.2.04, 12c)
preconfigured paramaters.
aws cloudwatch to monitor db
Automated backups:_ PIT recovery.
Database snapsots:- user initated backups.
Scale compute and memory resources
Multi AZ deployments:- 
RDS can be created in specific VPC.
SUpports TDE
Standard edition,stanadard edition 1,2 enterprise dition.
Oracle RAC is not supporteed on RDS.
Managng time-consuming dba admn taska are done by AWS.
CLoud wants DBA to foucs on APp optimization.

*********************
Understanding Backup and Recovery in RDS.
backup's and recovery not actually in dba's control.
Automated backup's during the backup window.
u don't do rman backup's backup's are done using storage volume snapshot instead of individual databases.
Allowed to do manual backups using create snapshos.
SInle AZ db instance results in a breif I/O suspension, hence it is adivsable to do it on dev tess env and not on Prod.
for Prod go with Multi AZ and offload the backups from standby db.
The first snapshot contains data for full db instance.
rest are incrmentals.
A new instance created at the time of restore.
A new instance can be created Point in time.
RDS uploads transaction logs of DB instances to S3 every 5 mins.


* U need to have subnet group for creating a RDS
so in VPC where u have 1 Public subnet and 1 Private subnet 
create 1 more Private subnet in different AZ other then the AZ of 1st Private Subnet.
1)Once it is created got to RDS and create subnet groups and choose 2 Private subnets.

Provision an RDS instance for Oracle.
choose only private subnets in the subnet groups.


MOnitoring RDS
AWS CLoudwatch
gathers metrics CPU utlilisation of the hypervisor.
collects and processes raw data from AMAZON RDS into readable,near real time metrics.
historical stats is done but u can do a near real time.
stats are recorded for more then 2 weeks
metrics is send over a period of 1 min
configure ur RDS engine to publish log data to log group.

ENhanced monitoring.
gatheres metrcis  from an agent on the instance.
which process is taking more time on CPU
more cost.
u can do it at intital stage or later
do not need a restart
enhanced metrics are send to cloudwatch  log Grops(RDSOSMETRICS)

RDS Monitoring:- See CLoudwatch 
also see logs and events under RDS.
U can also create alarms
to email

*****
create a manual snapshot of db
it doesn't do rman backups, it takes storage snapshots.
when u take these snapshots(backup of db, there is an I/o suspension) so it is recommended to do the backups on stanby site of prod server.
or
enable Multi-az deployments.
takesnapshot.

********Restore a db from RDS.
go to snapnshots-->restore snapshot
unline tradition way where there is an issue on prod u can do restore and recovery on prod iteself.
But with AWS RDS you have to create a new db from the available snapshots..can't do recovery on primary db.


*************DB patching in RDS.
go to console of db and modify to the latest PSU.
u can schedule the patch update or do it immediately..it will cause downtime.




Patching Oracle Database in Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) involves using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. Unlike patching a standalone Oracle Database installation where you have direct access to the server, patching an Oracle RDS instance is managed through AWS.

Here's an overview of the steps involved in patching an Oracle RDS instance:

1. **Determine the Patch Version**: Check the Oracle documentation or AWS RDS documentation to determine the latest available patch version for your Oracle RDS instance.

2. **Schedule Maintenance Window**: Patching an RDS instance requires a maintenance window during which the instance can be rebooted. Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to schedule a maintenance window that suits your requirements.

3. **Apply the Patch Using the AWS Management Console**:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the Amazon RDS dashboard.
   - Select your Oracle RDS instance.
   - Under "Instance actions" or "Modify", select "Modify".
   - Choose the desired DB Engine Version (patch version) from the dropdown menu.
   - Confirm the modification and apply the changes.

4. **Apply the Patch Using the AWS CLI**:
   - Use the `modify-db-instance` command with the `--engine-version` parameter to specify the desired patch version.
   - Example AWS CLI command:
     ```bash
     aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier your-db-instance-name --engine-version new-patch-version --apply-immediately
     ```
   - Replace `your-db-instance-name` with the identifier of your RDS instance and `new-patch-version` with the desired patch version.

5. **Monitor the Patching Process**: Once the patching process begins, monitor the status of your RDS instance using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

6. **Verify the Patch**: After the maintenance window is complete and the instance is back online, verify that the patch has been successfully applied. You can check the Oracle version to confirm.

Remember, when you schedule a maintenance window for patching an RDS instance, it will be rebooted during that time, causing temporary downtime. Ensure that you plan the maintenance window during off-peak hours to minimize the impact on your applications.

Always refer to the latest AWS RDS documentation and guidelines for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions on patching Oracle RDS instances.

In the background.
before doing patching AWS creates a snapshot of db before and after patch.
if something goes wrong it will use this snapshot to recover the db.
