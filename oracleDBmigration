Oracle on Ec2 migration to AWS RDS.

expdp of source schema
(schema level and object level migartion possible, but you can' to full db migration using datapump since you don't have access to SYS schema of AWS RDS)

create db link on source
CREATE DATABASE LINK RDSPDB
CONNECT TO admin IDENTIFIED BY tsgsupportkey
USING '(DESCRIPTION=
          (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=rdspdb.crit5ered0ee.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com)(PORT=1521))
          (CONNECT_DATA=(SID=ORCL)))';

Transfer the dumpfile to AWS RDS(AWS RDS is also hosted on EC2 in the background)
BEGIN
DBMS_FILE_TRANSFER.PUT_FILE(
source_directory_object => 'data_pump_dir',
source_file_name => 'expdpsam_user26apr.dmp',
destination_directory_object => 'DATA_PUMP_DIR',
destination_file_name => 'expdpsam_user26apr.dmp',
destination_database => 'RDSPDB' );
END;
/

and then do impdp
impdp admin@rdspdb DIRECTORY=DATA_PUMP_DIR dumpfile=expdpsam_user26apr.dmp logfile=expdp27apr.log remap_schema=sam_user:sam_user remap_tablespace=SAMP_T:USers


The dump file on RDS server takes space and this space is counted towards RDS usage. Its a good idea to delete this dump file

On RDS:
=======
exec utl_file.fremove('DATA_PUMP_DIR','expdpsam_user26apr.dmp');

Import the dump file (which is not available on RDS server) into RDS. You run the impdp on source server on RDS via oracle networking

On source:
==========
impdp admin@rdspdb DIRECTORY=DATA_PUMP_DIR dumpfile=scott.dmp logfile=import.log
